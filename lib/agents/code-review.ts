**Security Assessment:** ‚úÖ PASSED
- No obvious security vulnerabilities detected
- Input validation appears adequate
- Authentication mechanisms in place

**Performance Review:** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS ATTENTION  
- Consider implementing caching for repeated operations
- Database queries could be optimized
- Async/await patterns properly implemented

**Best Practices:** ‚úÖ GOOD
- Code follows TypeScript best practices
- Error handling is comprehensive
- Logging and monitoring integrated

**Recommendations:**
1. Add rate limiting for API endpoints
2. Implement request validation middleware
3. Consider adding unit tests for critical paths
4. Document API endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger

**Overall Score:** 85/100 - Good foundation, minor improvements needed`;

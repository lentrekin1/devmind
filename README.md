## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lentrekin1/devmind.git
cd devmind

# ⚠️ WARNING: Complex infrastructure required
# This setup requires significant technical expertise and infrastructure
# Not recommended for casual use - production deployment is complex

# Prerequisites (REQUIRED):
# - Kubernetes cluster (minimum 16 nodes with 32GB RAM each)
# - PostgreSQL with replication (primary + replica) 
# - Redis cluster (minimum 3 nodes)
# - Elasticsearch cluster (minimum 6 nodes)
# - Vector database (Pinecone or Chroma)
# - Multiple API keys (OpenAI, monitoring services)
# - SSL certificates and domain configuration
# - Terraform/Docker expertise required

# Install dependencies
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment (25+ variables required)
cp .env.example .env
# ⚠️ Configure all environment variables in .env
# ⚠️ Set up SSL certificates
# ⚠️ Configure Kubernetes configs and secrets
# ⚠️ Initialize vector database and embeddings

# Initialize infrastructure (requires DevOps expertise)
./scripts/setup-infrastructure.sh
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
terraform apply

# Start deployment (requires monitoring setup)
docker-compose up -d
kubectl apply -f manifests/
```

})
```

### Analytics Agent
```typescript
import { AnalyticsAgent } from '@/lib/agents/analytics'

const analytics = new AnalyticsAgent({
  aggregationWindow: "24h"
})
```
